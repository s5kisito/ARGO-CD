'How do we make sure that ARGOCD IS HIGHLY AVAILABLE?'

1. We Must Install ArgoCD with 'HIGH AVAILABILITY MODE' Meaning We Must:

- Install ArgoCD With The 'High Availability' manifests. 

'H.A: HIGH AVAILABILITY MODE' = 'manifests/ha'


kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml'
(Regular Installation)

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/ha/install.yaml'
( High Availability Mode Installation)


2. We Need To Make Sure That There Are 'Three(3) Different Nodes' Due To 'Pod-Antiaffinity Role
Defined In The Specs:'



3. 'REPLICAS'
We Need To Make Sure That We Set The Desired Amount of Replicas with a Minimum of '3'


4. 'PERSIST VOLUME':
We Need To Make Sure That We Persist The Volume for the  'Redis', 'PostgresSQL' Databases.

5. for Best Practice It Is Better To Use 'External Databases'
 for 'Redis', 'PostgresSQL' Databases.



6.  'Horizontal Pod Autoscaling'

Enable horizontal pod autoscaling for ArgoCD components to handle varying loads:
'kubectl autoscale deployment argocd-server --cpu-percent=50 --min=3 --max=10'

7. 'Multi-Cluster Configuration'

Consider deploying ArgoCD in a multi-cluster setup where ArgoCD instances are deployed across different Kubernetes clusters. This ensures high availability even if an entire cluster fails.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note :
'Dynamic Cluster Distribution'
It Ensures That the Workload Is Being Distributed Evenly Across 'Multiple Clusters' Based
On 'The Replicas Addition OR Deletion'..
