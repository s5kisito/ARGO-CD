You can use argocd admin to import and export all Argo CD data.

Make sure you have ~/.kube/config pointing to your Argo CD cluster.




Disaster recovery in ArgoCD involves preparing for and recovering from significant failures or disasters that could impact the availability and integrity of the ArgoCD deployment. Proper disaster recovery plans ensure that you can restore your ArgoCD environment to a functional state with minimal data loss and downtime. Here are the key aspects of disaster recovery in ArgoCD and steps for recovery:

'Disaster Recovery Planning':

1.Backup and Restore Strategy:

Regularly back up the ArgoCD configurations, including application manifests, cluster configurations, and ArgoCD secrets.
Store backups in a secure, redundant, and geographically diverse location.

2.High Availability:

Deploy ArgoCD in a highly available configuration to minimize the risk of downtime.
Use persistent storage for the ArgoCD database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and Redis cache, ensuring data durability.
External Database and Redis:

3.Consider using managed services for databases (e.g., Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL) and caching (e.g., Amazon ElastiCache for Redis) that provide built-in high availability and automated backups.
Documentation and Testing:

4.Document disaster recovery procedures and ensure team members are familiar with them.
Regularly test your disaster recovery plan to ensure it works as expected.


'Steps to Recover from a Disaster'

1.Identify the Scope of the Disaster:

2.Determine the extent of the impact and which components are affected (e.g., ArgoCD server, database, etc.).
Restore ArgoCD Components:

ArgoCD Server:
If the ArgoCD server is down, redeploy it using the original deployment manifests or Helm chart.
Database:
Restore the PostgreSQL database from the latest backup.
Ensure the restored database is configured to work with the ArgoCD deployment.
Redis Cache:
Restore or reconfigure the Redis cache, ensuring it has the latest data if using a backup.
Restore Configuration and Data:

3.Apply the latest backup of ArgoCD configurations (e.g., application manifests, cluster configurations).
Use argocd admin settings to restore ArgoCD settings from backup files.

4.Verify and Test:

Verify that all ArgoCD components are up and running.
Test the functionality of the ArgoCD server, ensuring it can connect to clusters and manage applications as expected.
Ensure that the restored data is consistent and applications are in the desired state.
